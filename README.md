## Overview
This project is a responsive e-commerce web page where users can browse a variety of products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The page dynamically displays product information fetched from a JSON file and adapts its layout to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Features include a dynamic cart with item increment and decrement functionality, a checkout modal for reviewing the order, and a "Start New Order" button that resets the cart.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I enhanced my skills in CSS by learning to use the :root selector and custom properties for defining global styles. Additionally, I gained experience working with JavaScript's fetch API to retrieve data from a local JSON file, which helped me understand how to render dynamic content on the page. Troubleshooting issues with JavaScript functions and using console.trace() to debug event handler problems gave me insight into function call stacks.

### Continued development
In the future I want to keep developing my javascript skills especially stacking functions. It was challenging to understand the function stack. Some function were being called unintentionally and I had to used consol.trace() to track them and troubleshoot the problems that arose because of this.
